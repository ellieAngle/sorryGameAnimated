### Management Plan:
#### Sprint 1:
- Front end: Basic implementation, no customization, set number of players, two dimensional design & basic animation
- Back end: game-play functionality delimited by existing front end, all rules implemented, functional control class
    1. Rules/Controller: 
        - primary responsibility - Ellie
        - secondary responsibility - Hayden
    2. Deck/Cards
        - primary responsibility - Hayden
        - secondary responsibility - Ellie
    3. Player/Pins
        - primary responsibility - Maddie
        - secondary responsibility - Nick
    4. Map/Front-End
        - primary responsibility - Nick
        - secondary responsibility - Everyone
#### Sprint 2:
- Front end: alert screens and 3d handling, create multiple maps to choose from, handle having different number of players
- Back end: adjust the backend to account for new front end features (especially new Maps & new player types)
    1. Multiple map creation and handling of that: Nick
    2. Handling Number of players/ type: Maddie
    3. Alert Screens, 3d objects etc.: Hayden, Ellie
#### Complete:
- Add in customization as seen fit, complete test and all features 
    - Have start screens for choosing language, # of players, map, and dimensionality of the game (2d vs 3d, custom pins/appearance)
- We will assign roles here as we see fit.
